				When I was in third grade my Mom was activated as a Navy Nurse to serve in the Persian Gulf 
				for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. This was when I learned how an event on the other side of 
				the world could directly impact my life. From that point forward I started to pay close 
				attention to world events. I loved learning about war, battles, and history. As I grew older 
				that passion only grew. At the same time, I have a huge passion for technology. I not only have 
				degrees in history and political science and a Master’s in International Relations but an associate’s 
				degree in web development. I love building data visualization websites that deal with social issues. 
				I built this site and my Youtube channel as a way to share information with people around the world. 
				I love sharing ideas and learning something new.

		<p>
			My educational background is as follows. I attended the University of California at Davis where I 
			double-majored in History and Political Science - focusing on International Relations. During my time 
			at UC Davis, I was a Marine Reservist. As soon as I graduated I was commissioned as an officer of Marines. 
			After graduating from The Basic School I was designated as a logistics officer. I served in Iraq and in 
			Afghanistan. In Iraq, I was a platoon commander leading convoys into the city of Fallujah to resupply the 
			Marines there. In Afghanistan, I was on a Joint Billet with the Army. During my time in the Marines, I 
			started to work on a master’s degree in International Relations. I eventually received my degree, from 
			Webster University. I then went to work in the Intelligence community - the CIA where I spent some time 
			overseas with them. Finally, I love technology and have an associate’s degree in web development.

		<h3 class='font center title-fix'>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			I’ve always loved technology - from first playing Super Mario Bros when I was in first grade to playing 
			with computers at school to surfing the World Wide Web on AOL. From a young age, I realized that technology 
			would change and influence the world. With my Mom in the Gulf War, I remember watching the news videos of 
			the cruise missiles taking out targets all over the country. During High School, I was part of the U.S. 
			First Robotics club and really helped it get going.  When I was at UC Davis I took a C++ class but found it 
			quite hard. I kept away from programming for most of the 2000s. It was not until 2013 that I slowly got 
			back into it. In 2015 I went to a coding boot camp Tech Talent South, got an internship, and then decided to 
			get an associate’s degree in web development. I’ve worked at one company using Vue.js making data 
			visualizations and recently I spent time working at a Health It company using PHP on an electronic 
			prescription system. I have over 120 projects on my Github page and most of them look at Data from Kaggle 
			where I build data visualizations websites. I know: PHP, Python, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
